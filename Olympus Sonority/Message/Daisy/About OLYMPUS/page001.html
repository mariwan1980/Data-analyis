<p>
	<span id="txt7">In Greek mythology, Mt.Olympus is the home of the twelve supreme gods and goddesses. </span>
	<span id="txt8">Olympus was named after this mountain to reflect its strong aspiration to create high quality, world famous products. </span>
</p>
<p>
	<span id="txt9">"Olympus" has been used as a trademark since the time of Takachiho Seisakusho, </span>
    <span id="txt10">the predecessor of Olympus Corporation. </span>
	<span id="txt11">In Japanese mythology, </span>
    <span id="txt12">it is said that eight million gods and goddesses live in Takamagahara, the peak of Mt.Takachiho. </span>
	<span id="txt13">The name "Olympus" was selected as the trademark because Mt.Olympus, like Mt.Takachiho, </span>
    <span id="txt14">was the home of gods and goddesses. </span>
	<span id="txt15">This trademark is also imbued with the aspiration of Olympus to illuminate the world with its optical devices, </span>
    <span id="txt16">just like Takamagahara brought light to the world. </span>
</p>
<p>
	<span id="txt17">Takachiho Seisakusho was renamed Takachiho Optical Co., Ltd. </span>
    <span id="txt18">In 1942, when optical products became the mainstay of the company. </span>
	<span id="txt19">In 1949, the name was changed again to Olympus Optical Co., Ltd. in an attempt to enhance its corporate image. </span>
</p>
<p>
	<span id="txt20">And in 2003, the company made a fresh start as Olympus Corporation, </span>
    <span id="txt21">to show its willingness to establish a dynamic corporate brand by unifying the corporate name and the well-known brand. </span>
	<span id="txt22">In recent years, </span>
    <span id="txt23">Olympus Corporation has focused on "Opto-Digital Technology" as its core competence, </span>
    <span id="txt24">and technological strengths that competitors cannot easily imitate, </span>
    <span id="txt25">to maximize corporate value and to become one of the top optical instrument manufacturers. </span>
